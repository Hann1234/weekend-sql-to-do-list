[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

The To-Do App

This is a 'TO DO' application. This is a to-do list that allows users to create a task through the front end UI, stores the created task within a database (SQL), displays tasks on the DOM (updated when a new task is added), allow the user to complete or delete a task, give a visual representation when a task is completed, and deleting the task removes it from the DOM as well as the database.
